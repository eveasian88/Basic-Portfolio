      <p>I am a strategic, analytical Linguist, with native fluency in five languages and a passion for working with languages and language data.</p>

      <p>Most of my professional life has been spent as a teacher. I helped facilitate a 100% student pass rate on the AP Spanish Language and Culture Exam for numerous years in a row, the only teacher at my institution with such a high success rate.</p>

      <p>One of my proudest achievements occurred after the Santa Rosa wildfires in October of 2017. The school where I was teaching burned to the ground. Students were split into four separate satellite campuses. I had to change the curriculum entirely. The students were grouped by grade level, but their language knowledge was very diverse. I couldn't teach the traditional way, so I adjusted my curriculum to a multi-level group project-based curriculum to make sure that all were served well and no one was lost; unified together one student's weakness became the group's strength. I’m very proud to say that despite the less than ideal learning conditions, none of my students fell through the cracks. When we returned to our campus in January 2018 utilizing portable classrooms, I caught them all up, and now, at the end of the school year, all students are on track and haven't lost any time on curriculum instruction. I am confident that all my students will be successful in their next level of language classes.</p>

      <P>Another accomplishment I’m most proud of is that many of my students stay in contact with me after graduation and tell me about their travel abroad experiences. I consider this a win because something in my class made them curious about the world, they continued to learn and found their own passion in language.</P>

      <p>I would welcome the opportunity to work with a company that will utilize my language training and knowledge in computational linguistics. Working in an artificial intelligence role that would allow me to be part of the future of language exploration is my dream job.</p>
